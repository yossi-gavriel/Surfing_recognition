Action recognition


Perform video classification on surfing exercises:

Air
Surfers have adapted the skateboard ollie and turned it into a surfing move, known as the Air. To perform the Air, you need to approach a 2- or 3-foot wave at high speed, launch off the lip of the wave, and fly over the wave before landing on its face. The key to mastering the Air is timing your approach so that you gain speed as you approach the lip of the wave. Pro surfer Josh Kerr emphasizes the importance of timing when performing the Air.
Red Bull pros who do it best: Julian Wilson, Kolohe Andino, Kalani David, Ian Crane, Jack Freestone, Josh Kerr

Cutback
The Cutback is a useful trick that allows you to reduce your speed and change directions. It involves shifting your weight to your back foot at the top of the wave and digging the left rail of your board into the wave while leaning your left hand down. Then, turn your head and twist your shoulders towards the curl to change direction and take you back to the steep part of the wave.

Foam Climb
The Foam Climb involves climbing the foam wall of a wave, building momentum, and applying a solid bottom turn to gain enough power to get you over the foam. Use your shoulders and arms to pull yourself up and climb the whitewash. Maintain a low balanced stance, and put pressure on your back foot to handle the impact.
Red Bull pros who do it best: Mick Fanning

Tube Ride
The Tube Ride is the ultimate surfing trick that involves riding the hollow part of a wave while the curl's lip fully covers you, creating an aesthetically pleasing look. To perform the Tube Ride, you need to crouch and angle yourself tightly as you drop in ahead of the wave's lip. Stay centered on your board when inside the tube, and stay above the white section of the wave to avoid slowing down or getting thrown off.

Alley Oop
The Alley Oop is an intense air jump that allows you to fly high over a wave while the shore's breeze keeps your board stuck to your feet. To perform the Alley Oop, find an open-faced wave with a breaking section, accelerate towards it, and bottom turn at a 45-degree angle. Bend your knees, let the nose of your surfboard pass the lip, kick your tail out, and pop off the lip.
Red Bull pros who do it best: Julian Wilson, John John Florence

Carve
The Carve is a move that lets you change your direction while inside the wave's opening. To perform the Carve, put all your weight on the board's rail and let it bury itself underwater, creating an arc shape within the wave's curl.
Red Bull pros who do it best: Jake Marshall, Mick Fanning, John John Florence

Rodeo Flip
The Rodeo Flip is a trick that was invented by Kelly Slater, who discovered it while surfing a wave. To perform the Rodeo Flip, you need to catch air at the top of the wave, grab your board, and flip forward or backward before landing back on the wave.
Red Bull pros who do it best: Jordy Smith, Mason Ho, Kelly Slater

Flynnstone Flip
The Flynnstone Flip is a kickflip perfected by famous surfer Flynn Novak. To perform the Flynnstone Flip, approach an open wave at high speeds, catch enough air to move forward and do a 360 flip at once, while grabbing your board in the middle of a backflip.

Bottom Turn:
According to pro surfer Tom Curren, the bottom turn is the foundation for the rest of your surfing moves. To perform this maneuver, take off for the wave late and remain steep within it. Time your bottom turn perfectly so you can twist without losing speed. Stay low, bending your knees, and distributing your weight evenly over the board. Put pressure on your toes as the rail finds the water's surface.

Snap:
To perform a snap, find a steep wave and perform your best bottom turn. Use the board to direct yourself up the face of the wave at a 30- to 50-degree angle. Once you're halfway over the wave's crest, turn your shoulders toward the wave and lift your arms, pushing away from the board with your back leg. Some Red Bull pros who are known for their snapping skills include Kai Otton, Freddy P, Nat Young, and Kekoa Bacalso.

360:
For a carving 360, you'll approach a 45-degree angle wave. Keep your speed and drive your board toward the wave's lip. Turn your board against the whitewater as you rotate, transferring your weight to your front foot. This move involves fully rotating while on the face of the wave.



Plan: 

Section 1:

1. Cut video sessions from dedicated surfing pools
2. Use object detection model that trained dedicated pools 
3. Run surfing events detection on the videos with the model from 2


Section 2:

Using the previous project: 

1. Create file with the events ranges for each surfing video:

	a. Run the surfing event's detection and create pickle file with the ranges. 
	b. Combine the actual ranges. 


2. Create direcory for each excercise.

3. Export every detected excercise as video.

4. Clean the dataset created by 3

5. Run video classification training + inference

6. Create surfing events detection: 
	
	Run surfing events detection on the videos 
	For each detected event:
		Use the model on the detected frames range to get the action classification
		Export the results to pickle file
		
7. Run evaluation on the predicted ranges.
